# *Teddy* and *Happy* photoz catalogues <img  align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COINtoolbox/photoz_catalogues/master/images/coin.png" width="200"> 


This repository contains the photometric redshift catalogues presented in [Beck et al, 2016]() - *On the realistic validation of photometric redshifts, or why
Teddy will never be Happy*.

This is one of the products of the third edition of the [COIN Residence Program](http://iaacoin.wix.com/crp2016), which took place in August/2016 in Budapest (Hungary) . 

Any questions/suggestions should be sent to iaa.coin@gmail.com .


## *Teddy* 


This catalogue was design to isolate the effect of limited spectroscopic sample coverage in colour/magnitude space.

It is constructed from [SDSS-DR12](http://www.sdss.org/dr12/) spectroscopic sample and is maintained by [Chien-An Lin](http://linc.tw/) (CEA, France) 

## *Happy*


This catalogue was design to reproduce the effect of distinct photometric error distribution and its convolution with colour/magnitude space coverage between the spectroscopic and photometric samples. 

All photometry was taken from [SDSS-DR12](http://www.sdss.org/dr12/) and spectroscopic was gathered from a set of different sources (see  [Beck et al, 2016]() for further details). 

*Happy* is mantained by [Robert Beck](https://github.com/beckrob) (ELTE, Hungary).
